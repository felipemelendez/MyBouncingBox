# MyBouncingBox

The (0, 0) coordinate (x, y) is at the very top left of your screen.
The box moves diagonally and each time it reaches a border it will change direction of the border it touched.
If the box is moving bottom-right:
-- when it reaches the bottom border it will go top.
-- when it reaches the right border it will go left.
