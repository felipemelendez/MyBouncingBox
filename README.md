# MyBouncingBox

Complete an index.html file with the missing javascript code in order to replicate the famous Windows Screensaver - Bounce

You need to replace the content of the "div" my_bouncing_box with your Qwasar's login in downcase.

You need to move the "div" with the id my_bouncing_box diagonally.

We defined the (0, 0) coordinate (x, y) at the very top left of your screen.
The box must move diagonally and each time it reaches a border it will change direction of the border it touched.
If the box is moving bottom-right:
-- when it reaches the bottom border it will go top.
-- when it reaches the right border it will go left.

We let you choose the speed rate for the movement of the box. Between 0.3 and 1 second seems to be good values.

You cannot change the value of the html, moving the box needs to be done using javascript.
